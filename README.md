Abstract: Fires bring up the debate about their impact on Brazil’s economic growth. Some processing
tools such as cointegration and, especially, the correlation have been applied for identifying possible
transmission or contagion mechanisms between distinct time series. This paper adopts the detrended
cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) and rolling window approach to investigate the dynamic coupling
between fires and the evolution of some key variables related to Brazil’s economic growth (e.g.,
agricultural planted area, ethanol production, rainfall in the midwest region and gross domestic
product) covering two periods, namely from January 2012 to August 2016 (before the Brazilian
presidential impeachment occurred in 2016) and from September 2016 to April 2021, covering the
post-impeachment scenario, with the new government policies in the environmental sector. The
results show a positive cross-correlation between the level of fires versus planted area of all cereals,
leguminous and oleaginous in Brazil (mostly Soybean and Corn) and versus ethanol production
(a renewable energy generation). It is also possible to verify some impact level on the Brazilian gross
domestic product. Furthermore, we observed quantitatively, by means of the adopted methods that
fires in Brazil have the potential to damage economic growth and some activities addressed in this
study can also harm the environment in both mid and long-term.
